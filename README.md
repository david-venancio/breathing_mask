# breathing_mask
An open-source ultra-thin breathing mask (category : disposable)
NOT FINISHED - NOT USABLE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Arguments for this : 
- developped for mass-production
- can be bio-degradable if 3D-printed with PLA
- scalable
- thermoformable
- no glue needed
- low volume so uses less material than other known masks
- the shape can be used in other machines than 3D-printers
