# breathing_mask
An open-source ultra-thin breathing mask 
(category : disposable, non sealing, without filter)
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Arguments for this : 
- Developped for mass-production on 3D-printers
- Can be bio-degradable if 3D-printed with PLA (and covered to make it waterproof)
- Scalable
- Thermoformable
- No glue needed if well 3D-printed and assembled
- Low volume so uses less material than other known masks
- The shape can be used in other machines than 3D-printers (and pins added afterward)

This was made following recomendations from european authorities. 
It has to be covered with a skin-friendly product.

No special License. The STL and BLEND files are totally free.
